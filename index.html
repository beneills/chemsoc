<p align="justify">We understand how difficult and confusing it can be in the first few weeks of being at a new university, and so we have a parenting scheme in place where Year 1 students are partnered with Year 2 students, to offer you support. If you need any other help, feel free to get in contact with any committee member or email chemsoc@soton.ac.uk.
